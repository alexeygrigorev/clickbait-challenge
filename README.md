# Clickbait Challenge

The 3rd place solution to the clickbait challenge at http://www.clickbait-challenge.org/


The idea:

- Train 4 SVM models to predict the mean on the following features:
  - post content
  - title
  - keywords
  - all text together
- In addition to that, train 4 more modes to predict the std
- Combine these 4+4 models with one ET model

The images were not used in this approach
